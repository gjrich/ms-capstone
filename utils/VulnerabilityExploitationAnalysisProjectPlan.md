# Vulnerability Exploitation Analysis Project Plan

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between published security vulnerabilities and their real-world exploitation. Using data from various cybersecurity sources, we aim to answer four key research questions:

1. **Seasonal Patterns**: Are there seasonal patterns in vulnerability exploitation (holidays, fiscal year-end)?
2. **Critical Patching Windows**: What is the "critical patching window" between vulnerability disclosure and observed exploitation?
3. **Predictive Attributes**: What vulnerability attributes are most predictive of subsequent exploitation?
4. **COVID-19 Impact**: How did the COVID-19 pandemic affect vulnerability and breach patterns?

## Data Sources

- **National Vulnerability Database (NVD)**: Vulnerability metadata (2017-2024)
- **CISA Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEV) Catalog**: Exploitation dates and details
- **EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System)**: Exploitation probability metrics
- **Exploit-DB**: Public exploit availability information

## Project Phases

### Phase 1: Data Preparation and Integration (2-3 weeks)

#### 1.1 Data Understanding
- Review each data source structure in detail
- Document schema and available fields
- Identify key fields for joining datasets (primarily CVE IDs)
- Assess data quality issues, missing values, and format inconsistencies

#### 1.2 Database Design
- Create SQLite database schema
- Define tables for vulnerabilities, exploitations, EPSS scores, and exploits
- Establish relationships between tables
- Create views for simplified analysis queries

#### 1.3 Data Processing and Loading
- Process NVD JSON files to extract vulnerability data
- Process CISA KEV CSV/JSON for exploitation information
- Import EPSS scores for exploitation probability
- Process Exploit-DB data for public exploit availability
- Clean and standardize data
- Calculate derived fields
- Load processed data into SQLite database

### Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (1-2 weeks)

#### 2.1 Basic Statistics and Data Profiling
- Generate summary statistics for each table
- Calculate vulnerability counts by year, severity, vendor
- Analyze exploitation rates and timelines
- Create baseline visualizations

#### 2.2 Data Quality Assessment
- Identify and handle outliers
- Address missing data issues
- Document data limitations and biases

### Phase 3: Research Question Analysis (3-4 weeks)

#### 3.1 Question 1: Seasonal Patterns
- Aggregate exploitation events by month, quarter, holiday periods
- Implement time series decomposition
- Test for statistically significant patterns
- Visualize patterns using heatmaps and time series plots

#### 3.2 Question 2: Critical Patching Windows
- Calculate time intervals between disclosure and exploitation
- Analyze distribution of patching windows
- Study factors affecting patching speed
- Perform survival analysis to model time-to-exploitation

#### 3.3 Question 3: Predictive Vulnerability Attributes
- Engineer features from CVSS metrics and other vulnerability attributes
- Build machine learning models (Random Forest)
- Evaluate model performance using cross-validation
- Analyze feature importance to identify key predictive attributes

#### 3.4 Question 4: COVID-19 Impact Analysis
- Define pre-COVID and post-COVID time periods
- Compare vulnerability publication rates, exploitation rates, and timing
- Test for statistically significant differences
- Visualize trends over the pandemic timeline

### Phase 4: Results Integration and Reporting (2-3 weeks)

#### 4.1 Results Integration
- Find connections between the four research questions
- Identify patterns that appear across multiple analyses
- Develop unified framework for understanding vulnerability exploitation

#### 4.2 Visualization Creation
- Develop polished visualizations for each research question
- Create integrated dashboard or presentation visuals
- Ensure visualizations effectively communicate key findings

#### 4.3 Final Report Preparation
- Document methodology in detail
- Present findings for each research question
- Discuss implications for cybersecurity practices
- Acknowledge limitations and potential future work
